Limit your intake of saturated fats, trans fats, sodium, and added sugars.\n*   **Be Physically Active:** Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (like brisk walking, cycling, or swimming) per week, spread throughout the week. Include muscle-strengthening activities at least two days a week.\n*   **Maintain a Healthy Weight:** Being overweight or obese increases the risk of heart disease. Work with your doctor or a dietitian to create a plan if needed.\n*   **Don't Smoke:** Smoking damages blood vessels and increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. If you smoke, quitting is one of the best things you can do for your heart.\n*   **Limit Alcohol:** If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. This generally means up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men.\n*   **Manage Stress:** Chronic stress can negatively impact your heart health. Find healthy ways to cope, such as exercise, meditation, yoga, hobbies, or spending time with loved ones.\n*   **Get Enough Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.\n*   **Regular Check-ups:** Visit your doctor regularly",
