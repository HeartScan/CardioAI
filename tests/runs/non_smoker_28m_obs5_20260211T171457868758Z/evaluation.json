    "The assistant started with a variation of the required intro phrase, which is acceptable. However, it did not consistently include the disclaimer. The tone was polite and professional throughout. Lifestyle recommendations were comprehensive and appropriate for the patient. However, it failed to ask about symptoms related to the episodes, which is crucial given the patient's metrics."
