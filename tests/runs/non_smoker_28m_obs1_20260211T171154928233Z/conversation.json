Here are some general recommendations:\n\n*   **Eat a Heart-Healthy Diet**: Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins (like fish, poultry, beans), and healthy fats (like those in olive oil, avocados, nuts). Limit intake of saturated fats, trans fats, sodium, and added sugars.\n*   **Be Physically Active**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (like brisk walking, cycling, or swimming) per week, plus muscle-strengthening activities twice a week.\n*   **Maintain a Healthy Weight**: Being overweight or obese increases the risk of heart disease.\n*   **Don't Smoke**: Smoking damages blood vessels and increases heart disease risk. If you smoke, quitting is one of the best things you can do for your heart.\n*   **Manage Stress**: Find healthy ways to cope with stress, such as exercise, meditation, yoga, or spending time in nature.\n*   **Get",

Given your activity level, here are a few things to consider:\n\n1.  **Gradual Progression**: If you are considering increasing the intensity or duration of your physical activity, do so gradually. Suddenly starting a very intense workout routine can sometimes put undue stress on your heart.\n2.  **Listen to Your Body**: Pay attention to any unusual symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations, especially during or after exercise. If you experience these, stop the activity and consult a doctor.\n3.  **Regular Check-ups**: Even though you feel healthy, it's still wise to have regular check-ups with your doctor.
