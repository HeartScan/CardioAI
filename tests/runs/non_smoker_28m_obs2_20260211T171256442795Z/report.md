## Conversation (truncated)
- **cardio 1**: I am CardioAI, a virtual cardiologist assistant.  I have reviewed your heart rhythm recording. Based on the data, no significant rhythm abnormalities were detected.  Would you like general recommendations for maintaining heart health?  If you answer "yes", I can provide some general preventive recommendations. If you answer "no", we will conclude our conversation.  === Block 1. Questionnaire and r

To answer your questions:   - I am male.   - I am 28 years old.   - I live in the EU.   - I have never smoked.   - I do not have high blood pressure.   - I don't know my cholesterol levels.

- **cardio 3**: 1.  **Acknowledge answers:** Confirm the user's answers to the questionnaire and self-assessment questions. 2.  **Provide general recommendations:** Offer general advice for maintaining heart health based on the user's profile (young male, no smoking, no hypertension, unknown cholesterol). 3.  **Maintain friendly and empathetic tone.** 4.  **Keep it short and clear.** 5.  **End with the disclaimer

- **patient 6**: No rhythm abnormalities were detected in your heart rhythm recording.   Would you like general recommendations for maintaining heart health?
- **cardio 7**: Would you like general recommendations for maintaining heart health?".  This response is a bit confusing.

The user's response: "No rhythm abnormalities were detected in your heart rhythm recording. Would you like general recommendat
- **patient 8**: I confirm that no rhythm abnormalities were detected in your heart rhythm recording.   Would you like general recommendations for maintaining heart health?

The user is confirming the result and then asking the question again, perhaps to ensure I understood. 3.  The user is confirming the result and then asking the question again, perhaps because they are unsure if they want the recommendations.  Giv
