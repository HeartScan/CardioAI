These electrodes detect the tiny electrical signals that your heart generates as it beats.\n\nThe machine then records these signals, creating a graph that shows your heart's rhythm and rate. This helps doctors identify any abnormalities in your heart's electrical activity, such as irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), which can be a sign of various heart conditions.",
