Add the disclaimer.Thank you for providing that information.\n\nBased on your questionnaire/risk factors, here are some general lifestyle recommendations to help maintain heart health:\n\n*   **Regular Exercise:** Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (like brisk walking, cycling, or swimming) per week.\n*   **Healthy Diet:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins (like fish, poultry, beans), and healthy fats (like olive oil, avocados). Limit intake of saturated fats, trans fats, sodium, and added sugars.\n*   **Weight Management:** Maintain a healthy weight through a combination of diet and exercise.\n*   **Stress Management:** Find healthy ways to cope with stress, such as meditation, yoga, deep breathing exercises, or spending time in nature.\n*   **Adequate Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.\n*   **Limit Alcohol:** If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation (up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men).\n*   **Avoid Smoking:** Smoking significantly increases the risk of heart disease. If you smoke, quitting is one of the best things you can do for your heart health.\n\nWe also recommend repeating the heart rhythm recording in 1–2 weeks (or as directed by a doctor) to clarify the trend over time. This will help us understand if the episodes are consistent or if there are other factors contributing to your heart rhythm.\n\n***\n\n*Disclaimer: This advice does not replace a doctor’s visit.*",
